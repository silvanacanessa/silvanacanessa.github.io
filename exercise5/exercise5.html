            <p>In early Greek medical writing based on the theory of the four bodily humours, it was assumed that women’s humours were cool and wet, as opposed to men’s, which were hot and dry. They theorized that women required sexual intercourse to heat and drain the blood, which is what led to women’s insatiable desire for semen. This uncontrollable want was thought to make women unable to control their desires and more lustful than men (Groneman, xviii). <br><br><strong>
                This early medical theory, though archaic by modern standards, laid the foundation for enduring assumptions about female sexuality that persist to this day.</strong></p></section>
