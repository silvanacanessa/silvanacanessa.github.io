                    <p class="hover-text">Hippocratic medicine, based on the theory of the four bodily humours, assumed
                        that women’s
                        humours
                        were cool and wet, as opposed to men’s, which were hot and dry. <br><br>
                        Therefore, women required sexual intercourse to heat and drain the blood, which is what led to
                        women’s <i>insatiable desire for semen.</i><br><br>
                        <strong>This early medical theory, though archaic by modern standards, laid the foundation for
                            enduring assumptions about female sexuality that persist to this day.</strong></p>

                        witchcraft and heavily
                        influenced to ignite and sustain the witch-hunting hysteria in Europe. <br><br>
                        It explained that women, due to their insatiable lust, were more prone to witchcraft, and
                        authors
                        suggested that women’s moral and mental weakness was the origin of this deviance. </p>

                    <p class="hover-text">As the time of witch accusations diminished in relevance, a new allegation
                        emerged:
                        “nymphomaniac”.
                        <br> <br>
                        Despite the change in terminology, the underlying accusation stayed the same, an overly sexual
                        woman
                        harbouring hidden hostility and believed to be able to diminish a man’s sexual vigor.

                        In 1775 was the first comprehensive study of nymphomania as a medical diagnosis, attributing
                        strong
                        sexual desire in women as a symptom.
