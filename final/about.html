            <h2 class="title">Wicked Bodies: The Pathologization of Female Sexuality</h2>In
            early Greek medical writing based on the theory of the four bodily humours, it was assumed that women’s
            humours were cool and wet, as opposed to men’s, which were hot and dry. They theorized that women required
            sexual intercourse to heat and drain the blood, which is what led to women’s insatiable desire for semen.
            This uncontrollable want was thought to make women unable to control their desires and more lustful than men
            (Groneman, xviii).

            <br><br>

            <strong>This early medical theory, though archaic by modern standards, laid the foundation for enduring
                assumptions about female sexuality that persist to this day.</strong>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Website Concept</h2>
            For centuries, women’s bodies and desires have been scrutinized, controlled, and medicalized, whether
            through witch trials, outdated medical diagnoses, or, more recently, viral internet discourse. <br><br>This
            website takes an educational approach to showcase how historical accusations of witchcraft and
            nymphomania were used to pathologize female sexuality and how those same narratives persist today
            <br><br>
            By adapting a zine I created into an interactive format, the website will guide users through
            moments in history when women were labelled as dangerous, deviant, or diseased for failing to conform to
            societal expectations. The goal is to make this information engaging and accessible while revealing
            unsettling parallels between past and present.
